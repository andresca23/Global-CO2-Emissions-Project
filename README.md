# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Project  
### OM 422 – Operations Management & Analytics  
### Team Members: Sarah Tapia • Ross Lajeunesse • Andres Cadena • Marcos Lopez  

This repository contains our team’s Power BI + RStudio project analyzing **global fossil fuel CO₂ emissions**.  
Using historical data from *Our World in Data*, we built an interactive dashboard and performed statistical analysis to compare countries’ fossil fuel usage, emissions, production, consumption, and net trade behavior.

# 📊 Dashboard Pages & Insights

## **1️⃣ Overview – Average CO₂ Emissions by Fuel Type**  
This page summarizes major global emitters and allows dynamic filtering by country.  
Fuel types include: Coal, Gas, Oil, Cement, Flaring, and Land Use.

---

## **2️⃣ Country Comparison – Consumption vs Production**  
A scatterplot comparing:
- CO₂ **production per capita**
- CO₂ **consumption per capita**
- Bubble size = population  

This highlights whether countries are **net consumers** or **net producers** of fossil fuel emissions.

---

## **3️⃣ Trends Overtime (1750–2023)**  
A historical visualization of:
- CO₂ emissions per capita  
- Emissions relative to GDP  
- Industrialization patterns  
- Long-term cross-country comparisons  

---

## **4️⃣ Data, Terms & Definitions**  
Includes:
- Definitions of CO₂ & fossil fuel categories  
- Explanation of each measure  
- Dataset notes  
- Power BI link  
- GitHub portfolio link

# 🧪 RStudio Statistical Analysis

## **5️⃣ Net Importer vs Exporter Analysis**  
Using tidyverse and ggplot2, our team created:
- Net trade bar charts for Coal, Oil, and Gas  
- Clear identification of major importers and exporters  

Example insight:
- **US, Germany, Japan → Net importers**  
- **Russia, Saudi Arabia → Net exporters**

---

## **6️⃣ Proportional Fossil Fuel Trade**  
We created proportional bar charts showing net trade from –100% to +100%:  
- –100% = exclusive exporter  
- +100% = exclusive importer  

---

## **7️⃣ Consumption vs Production Over Time**  
R-generated visuals comparing:
- Fossil fuel consumption  
- Fossil fuel production  
- Differences in trends between countries  

These visuals support the Power BI scatter plot.
